# Needle-Segmentation

NeedleSAM was created to solve the needle segmentation problem posed in Advances In Imaging Informatics (BIOENGR 224B). 224B is a graduate bioengineering class that focuses on reading cutting edge research papers on computation in medicine. This includes image analysis as well as information retrieval systems.

NeedleSAM is a version of [MedSAM](https://rdcu.be/dIPUC) [1] that has been fine tuned to segment a needle that has been inserted into a patient during a chest CT scan. Through visual analysis, the model performs well, however more rigorous validation is coming soon.
